# Amazon Ads Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes [Amazon Ads staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads_source/#!/overview/amazon_ads_source/models/?g_v=1&g_e=seeds), which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Amazon Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Names columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Amazon Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Amazon Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads).

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Amazon_ads connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `amazon_ads` transformation package)
If you  are **not** using the [Amazon Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads), include the following `amazon_ads_source` package version in your `packages.yml` file.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read dbt's Package Management documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/amazon_ads_source
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `amazon_ads` schema. If this is not where your Amazon_ads data is (for example, if your Amazon_ads schema is named `amazon_ads_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  amazon_ads_database: your_database_name
  amazon_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## Step 4: Disable models for non-existent sources
Your Amazon Ads connector may not sync every table that this package expects. If you do not have the `PORTFOLIO_HISTORY` table synced, add the following variable to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    amazon_ads__portfolio_history_enabled: False   # Disable if you do not have the portfolio table. Default is True.
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand for configurations</summary>

### Passing Through Additional Metrics
By default, this package will select `clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost` from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the following configurations to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) if desired, but not required. Use the following format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

> **Note** Ensure you exercised due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default (clicks, impressions, and cost) have been vetted by the Fivetran team maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, for example, metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You want to ensure whichever metrics you pass through are indeed appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels provided in this package.

```yml
vars:
    amazon_ads__campaign_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field"
    amazon_ads__ad_group_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
    amazon_ads__advertised_product_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field"
      - name: "a_second_field"
    amazon_ads__targeting_keyword_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "this_field"
    amazon_ads__search_term_ad_keyword_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default, this package will build the Amazon_ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `amazon_ads_source`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Amazon Ads staging data to be written, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    amazon_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    amazon_ads_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
